# My Evolution in Python!

I developed the most of my Forex Trading codes based on this API from IqOption Broker : 
GitHub - https://github.com/Lu-Yi-Hsun/iqoptionapi
Document -  https://lu-yi-hsun.github.io/iqoptionapi/candle/candle/#get-candles

I used this API to develop bots of trading automatic : 
 
'botSgale' : It´s a Bot that read instructions of time and currency and effectuate the trade in the correct moment.

'botSgaleMaoFixa' : It´s the same as above.

'CatalogadorSinais' : It's A cataloguer that receive instructions and filters and try to find patterns in between currency and time, fixing the best hours to trading predicting a good result.

'WebScrapping' : It´s a WebScrapping made with Selenium and BeautifulSoup capturing the data of 'Pivot - Points' of the site www.Investing.com/pivot-points and reducing it to common values, getting high chances of resistence or suport in the Forex graphics.

'Ex1, Ex2, Ex3' : Exercises proposed in my last tests of college (2020).
